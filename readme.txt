The following files are included and all are required for this project to funtion:
     1. bank_account_project.php
     2. build_base_cube.php
     3. get_table.php
     4. jquery-1.9.1.js
     5. bank.sql

In order to run the project, a WAMP or LAMP server must be installed on your machine.
It is assumed that the user of this project knows how to install a WAMP or LAMP server, so the details for their installation will not be provided here.

Follow the following steps to prepare the project for use:
     1.  Unzip the included files into the directory of your choice. For best results, this folder should be in the /wamp/www directory or wherever you installed your server.
     2. The WAMP or LAMP server should have PHPMyAdmin (a program for working with the MySQL database already installed.
     3. Open PHPMyAdmin in your web browser and login.  The default username is root and the password field should be left blank (the password can be changed later.
     4.  Import the bank.sql file into your MySQL database using the PHPMyAdmin software.
     5.  Assuming the directory for your files is C:\wamp\www\SE157BProject, open your browser and type localhost/SE157BProject/bank_account_project.php
          This will take you to the home screen of the application, and you're good to go!  Enjoy!
